            <p>You can choose from a range of different album covers and paper types to create your own recipe book. <a target="_blank" class="link" href="#">Our custom photo book</a> are the most popular option as these can have up to 240 digitally printed pages, and are book-bound to make for a lasting keepsake. If you’re looking for something higher-end, a <a href="#" target="_blank" class="link">layflat album</a> would be another option, but please keep in mind that these pages are developed on Fuji photo paper, so like any photo print, will be a little sensitive to moisture.</p>
